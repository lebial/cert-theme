          <b>Data Security</b> is central to our mission at Certilytics. The Certilytics
          Security Framework includes HIPAA compliance and relevant data security protocols to meet
          highest industry standards of security and integrity. Our framework is based on HITRUST,
          SOC 2 Type II, NIST CsF, elements of GDPR, and internally defined requirements based on 
          industry best practices, client expectations, and contractual agreements.

          At Certilytics, we know trust is integral to the success of predictive analytics. 
          That's why we've developed a proprietary <b>Validation Framework</b> to ensure
          the highest standards of data, software, and process integrity - with continual
          checks as data moves through our platform, regular audits and certifications, as well
          as clear data governance and security policies throughout our organization.

          Since its founding in 2014, Certilytics has established a climate of trust, collaboration

          in our approach to data management, architecture, and security.
